        <p><strong>Shadow performance</strong> was selected as the medium for engaging with and performing folklore narratives. It provides a simple, anonymous format with abundant creative potential. Shadow theatre involves the performance of moving images by positioning the body or props between a light source and a translucent screen (Elizabeth, 2024). This medium is highly effective for storytelling as it allows performers to dramatize and interpret narration through body language.</p>

        <p>This method serves as a tool to negotiate between old and new interpretations of stories from the national folklore collection. A narrator reads aloud their chosen story from the archive, while a group of four to five students create abstract shadow shapes behind the screen. The abstract shadows represent characters and symbols from the story, adding another layer of visuals to the narration. The use of shadow preserves a sense of ambiguity, inviting the audience to interpret the meaning, while also maintaining the anonymity of the individual performers, emphasizing the co-creation involved in the group’s story.</p>

        <p><strong>Workshop Outline:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workshop 1:</strong> Introduction with students, discussion of motto “Ar Scáth a Chéile” and project aims. Presentation of the Dúchas.ie ‘Schools Collection’. Students will select their favourite stories and be prepared to explain why they enjoyed these particular versions.</li>
            <li><strong>Workshop 2:</strong> Reflection on folklore findings through writing and drawing. Introduction to shadow performance, followed by activities like shadow tag and team-building exercises. Groups of four-five children will select two folk tales for the final performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Workshop 3:</strong> Facilitation of group choreographies. Introduction of props and allocation of roles for each group member. Opportunity to perform a “workshopped” version of their stories using a sheet and light source in the classroom.</li>
            <li><strong>Workshop 4:</strong> In-school performance & recording. Performance for other class groups in the school hall. Recording of audiovisual materials suitable for incorporation into the gallery performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Luan Gallery Performance:</strong> Open-evening public event where students showcase their folklore-inspired shadow performances to family and friends. For the exhibition opening, students will perform their choreographies using the shadow technique, alongside multimedia installations, including recordings of them reading and responding to the stories. This project reimagines the archives, keeping their relevance as living cultural traditions for younger generations.</p>

        <p>The above provides a semi-structured plan for implementing the workshop with a single class group (for example, fourth class, ages 9-11). The plan may be adapted based on time or available resources. A <strong>Garda Vetting</strong> process would ensure that facilitators assisting with the workshop are certified to work with children. Since the pilot version of this project is envisioned to take place in Athlone, school management in the area would be consulted to decide on a suitable age range for participation, and inter-school collaboration would be encouraged for the final performance.</p>
