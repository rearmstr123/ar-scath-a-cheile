            The <i>Ar Scáth A Chéile</i> project aims to revitalize archived Irish folklore through the expressive medium of movement. It is structured around a series of shadow performance workshops with local primary school children in Athlone inspired by stories from the National Folklore Collection, which will culminate in performances at the municipal Luan Gallery. The title of the project originates from the old Irish proverb "<strong><i>Ar scáth a chéile</i></strong> a mhaireann na daoine” [people live <strong><i>in each other’s shadows</i></strong>]. This motto eloquently captures the respect for shared knowledge, connection to community, and co-creation that is deeply ingrained in Irish cultural heritage practices and will serve as the core philosophy underpinning the project.

            <p>
                The art of storytelling in Ireland is an ancient and respected one. The terms ‘scéalaí’ and ’seanchaí’ distinguish between different types of storytellers, depending on whether they recounted grand, legendary tales or more familiar, local stories. Regardless of how familiar the story, those held in highest esteem were skilled at delivering memorable performances full of gesticulation and emotion. As the oral tradition began to decline in the twentieth century, efforts to preserve the practice were made by Irish writers and collectors. Most sought to record as many stories in detail as possible, to account for different techniques and turns of phrase across provincialities (Kiberd, 2005, p. 47). Ireland’s National Folklore Collection (NFC) was established during this period. Among its archives, ‘The School’s Collection’ consists of approximately 740,000 pages of folklore compiled by 50,000 primary schoolchildren in the 1930s (National Folklore Collection, 2025). Their accounts were later scanned, categorised and made accessible to the public through a user-friendly database on Dúchas.ie (The Dúchas Project, 2025).
            </p>
            <p>
                Dúchas.ie offers a comprehensive knowledge base of Irish folklore and an accessible platform for engaging with written Irish heritage. ‘The Schools Collection’ positions the children in the role of a first-person storyteller, bearing witness to the events of the story in typical seanchaí familiarity. Missing from these archives however, are methods of safeguarding the more transient aspects of the oral tradition, the embodied elements of its performance. According to Triona Ní Shíocháin “…orality is much more than just a precursor to words on a page, and its true potency lies in the moment of performance itself”. Rather than viewing oral knowledge as an object of history, it can equally be understood as social processes which have shaped meaning-making and thought formation in society (Shíocháin, 2017, p. 3). The folklore collection may preserve the content of stories, but it fails to capture the embodied and temporal aspects which strengthen the impact of its delivery. Without establishing a tradition of actively engaging with the archives and reenacting these stories, the cultural significance and community relevance of the Irish oral tradition will gradually fade and survive solely in the archives.

                Through reenactment of folklore, Ar Scáth A Chéile offers a way to negotiate the relationship between documentation and artistic production. Moving away from restoration efforts of traditional heritage conservation movements, re-enactment offers a flexible methodology for revitalising and negotiating concepts of tradition, heritage, and cultural identity (Dupré et al., 2020, pp. 19–21). This mode of engaging with documented folklore allows children to reflect upon the oral tradition while inviting new meanings to emerge through creative experimentation. The workshops will engage children to select stories from their local area and develop creative responses through shadow performance. The children are invited to reinterpret the stories, questioning and disrupting the stagnant state of the written text. The use of shadow performance as a medium preserves a sense of ambiguity which invites the audience to openly interpret its meaning, while maintaining the anonymity of individual performers, emphasising the co-creation involved in the group’s story (Elizabeth, 2024).

                The project will be showcased at the municipal Luan Gallery in Athlone, grounding the performances in a venue which is intimately connected to the community’s heritage. It begins with a live showcase in the main showroom where school groups perform their shadow reenactments for 45 minutes at a time, after which the audience will be invited to a reception in the adjacent exhibition rooms. Following the opening event, a two-month-long exhibition will be held, featuring English and Irish language video recordings of children’s shadow performances, textual documents sourced from duchas.ie, audio recordings of children storytelling, and written reflections from workshops with the schoolchildren. This exhibition will be free to the public, while the live opening performance will be ticketed to ensure safe capacity management.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pilot programme is envisioned to take place in Luan Gallery Athlone with students from local primary schools but has the capacity to be scaled up and performed in municipal galleries or community centres throughout the country.
