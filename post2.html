        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">The art of oral storytelling in Ireland is an ancient and respected one. The storyteller occupied an important role in Irish society, to the extent that a distinction is made between two types of storyteller, the ‘scealaí’ and the ‘seanchaí’. The scéalaí often held a higher status for the length and provenance of his stories, however the seanchaí narrated tales concerning familiar places, families and local legends, as though he himself had witnessed it. Regardless of audiences’ familiarity with stories, the storyteller was meticulously judged on their delivery. Storytellers held in highest esteem were those skilled at delivering memorable performances full of gesticulation and emotion, often deeply immersed in their narratives. Traditionally, locals crowded inside the home of the seanchaí, waiting patiently around the fireside for the performance to begin (Kiberd, 2005, pp. 44–45).</p>

        </div>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">As the tradition of storytelling began to dwindle in the twentieth century, efforts to preserve the continuity of the oral tradition were made by various Irish writers and collectors. Most sought to preserve the techniques of storytelling by recording as many stories in detail as possible, to account for techniques and turns of phrase in all provincialities (Kiberd, 2005, p. 47). Dúchas.ie takes a similar approach, offering a comprehensive knowledge base preserving written documents of Irish folklore and an accessible platform for engaging with Irish heritage. ‘The Schools Collection’ positions the children who recorded these stories in the role of the seanchaí. Their accounts are written in the first person, bearing witness to the events of the story in typical seanchaí familiarity. Missing from these archives however, are methods of safeguarding the more transient aspects of the oral tradition, the embodied elements of its performance which ensured its survival for generations. The schools collection may preserve the linguistic content of these stories, but it fails to capture the temporal and performative aspects of its delivery.</p>

        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">According to Triona Ní Shíocháin, “…orality is much more than just a precursor to words on a page, and its true potency lies in the moment of performance itself.” Although her claim emerges from a discussion of the Irish song tradition, her argument equally applies to the oral tradition of storytelling. Rather than viewing oral knowledge as documents reflecting history, she suggests they can equally be understood as social processes which have shaped history, with great influence on meaning-making and thought formation at the time (Shíocháin, 2017, p. 3).</p>


        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">Since the nineteenth century, the efforts of folklorists to collect, transcribe and publish pieces of oral tradition resulted in giving a new form to folklore that was textual in nature. Once collected and transferred into written text, it became a cultural heritage item whose importance depended on its preservation and representation of an element of a past time. By the turn of the twentieth century, folklore in this format had become increasingly valued as an inheritance item, suitable for nation building projects, with its authority often employed in politics, education and literature. At this stage, the folklore has reached its “second life” in the “folklore process”, having been concretely transformed, yet still serving a particular role in the meaning-making practices of a society (Carrassi, 2017, pp. 32–34).</p>

        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">The silencing of oral traditions in the second life of folklore points to an exclusion of a particular aspect of their transmission. The nature of oral transmission from person to person implies variation, re-interpretation and constant recreation of narratives by storytellers and their audiences. Yet the second wave points to the stagnation of this open event full of potential variants, now a closed system of unalterable texts. The craft of “oral formulaic composition” (Shíocháin, 2017, p. 3) stands in direct contrast to the closed textual artefact. This tension is not unique to nineteenth century European power politics. In ancient Greece the transition from orality and into literacy involved a confrontation with power and status in society. Scholars Thomas and Kent Webb suggest the infamous attack of Plato on Homer and poetry reveals an ancient conflict between practices of literacy and orality, where each aimed to perform and ensure authority of knowledge more convincingly than the other (Shíocháin, 2017, p. 7).</p>

        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">In the debate between the literate and oral tradition, arguments in favor of orality posit that oral poetry is an excellent medium for political thought and engagement. To understand this argument, it is crucial that we think beyond the limitations of text and imagine the moment of a story’s unfolding, the living moment of potentiality, where both ideas and identity can be renewed. The immediacy and potency of ideas being transmitted through oral performance has immense influence over individual thought (Shíocháin, 2017, p. 3).</p>

        <!-- Adding the highlighted quote -->
        <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 italic text-lg mb-6">
            As suggested by Carrassi, <em>‘When transferred on the written/printed page, a storytelling performance loses a number of its major, distinguishing, most expressive features, whereas those remaining become useless, having lost their actual function.’</em> (2017, p. 35)
        </blockquote>

        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">The memorability of folk tales greatly relies on the skill of their delivery which engages listeners deeply with their narratives. Without it, these stories gradually fade from lived cultural memory to survive solely as second wave folklore artefacts stored on the shelves and databases of the physical and digital archives respectively. I posit that it is necessary to establish a mode of engaging with the archives and reenacting these stories.</p>

        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">The Ar Scáth A Chéile project uses embodied performance as a tool for safeguarding the performative element of storytelling and to provide a way for children to reenact the oral tradition by engaging with cultural heritage recorded a century ago by children of their own age and locality. This project will re-open the stories' capability to be re-interpreted and varied from one form to another, and enhance its communicative potential for transmission onwards in cultural memory as a living heritage practice.</p>
